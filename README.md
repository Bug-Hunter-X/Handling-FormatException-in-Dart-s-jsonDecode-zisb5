# Handling FormatException in Dart's jsonDecode

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when using `jsonDecode` and provides a solution for handling `FormatException` exceptions.

The `bug.dart` file shows code that can throw a `FormatException` if the JSON data is not properly formatted. The `bugSolution.dart` file demonstrates how to handle this exception gracefully.
